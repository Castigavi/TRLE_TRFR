Use this button to create the SFX and SAM files. See the readme in the output folder for more details.
Before creating the SFX and SAM files you can modify any lines. This page of TRLE Sound Editor is a full editor with undo and redo and paste etc.

If adding or changing samples do not use ":" or "#" or spaces in the name.

TRLE Sound Editor saved Tu_Sounds.txt and then created a BAT file that executed pcwadsfx.exe. pcwadsfx.exe then created the SAM and SFX files.
The SAM and SFX files will have to be renamed to match your WAD file and then copied to your wad's folder.

You could edit the BAT file with the correct wad name and execute it yourself  to get SFX and SAM files with the wad name.

Frame: 24
Title:

The Standard Sounds.txt is displayed in blue so that it is not confused with sounds.txt that will be used for creating the SAM and SFX files.

You can see which sounds are considered general sounds and are associated with every wad by letter #g.

The Standard Sounds are loaded from StandardSounds.dat in the TRLE Sound Editor folder.
This dat file is a text file that can be modified but must be present in the folder for TRLE Sound Editor to work.

When a WAD file is opened all the sounds used by the animations are listed on this page.

The moveable that uses them is also listed.

For sound IDs 27, 50 and 62 the animations that use the sounds are also shown.


+--->
Note that the default TRLE karnak has PUZZLE_HOLE3 listed for most sounds which is wrong.

I think karnak has corrupt data but maybe there is a bug in TRLE Sound Editor when listing the moveables for sounds!

Title:

What gives with IDs 27, 50, 62?

27 is the "Don't_use_this_space" sound.
I wanted to see where it was used in the wad.

62 is the "LARA_PICKUP" sound.
In the Sounds.txt installed with TRLE this sound has no samples. I wanted to see where it was used.

50 is the "UNDERWATER_DOOR" sound.
You must not use this sound if you have baddies that shoot Lara with bullets. This causes the underwater door sound bug.
If you have operating underwater doors in a level with baddies too assign the underwater door sample to a different sound ID and change the animcommands for the animations to use the new sound ID.

If you have opened a WAD file and created a sounds.txt you can view the summary tab.

Frame: 38
Title: 
NumCallouts: 1
+--->
This lists all the sounds.

If a sound is present in the WAD, "WAD" is next to it.

If a sound is in the SFX, "SFX" will be next to it.

If a sound is a general sound, "g" will be next to it.

If a sound is in the created sounds.txt, "TXT" will be next to it.

I have this summary just as an investigation tool.

You want to make sure all the WAD sounds also have TXT.
If you have also included the general sounds you will want all g sounds to have TXT.

If you open some of the original Core Design wads you will see that the SFX sometimes does not contain all the WAD sounds and also that the SFX sometimes contains extra sounds.

In the Sounds.txt page make any modifications to the sounds you want then press Create SFX and SAM.
 
Remember only the sounds associated with the wad letters (in this case Tu) or marked as #g will be included in the SFX and SAM files.

Because we opened a wad file, TRLE Sound Editor knows the name of the wad so this time the SFX and SAM files are given the wadname. Copy the SFX and SAM files to your wad's folder to replace the SFX and SAM files.
