This plugin gives Lara the ability to leave customizable footprints behind her on selected floors.

Using:
Footprints use flipeffect 32 as an anim command. To set it:
In wadtool, add an anim command to play flipeffect 32 on the desired frame, and choose the correct foot in the "Condition" box.
Most of the needed animations (running, walking, etc.) in the default assets already have this flipeffect set. You are free to add or remove any of them as you wish.

--------------------------------------------------------------
Customization:
Customizing the footprints is done through TRNG scripting, via CUST_FOOTPRINT.
In addition, two flipeffects are available to customize the footprints while the game is running.
