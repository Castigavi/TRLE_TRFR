This plugin brings back two flare effects that were present in TR2 and TR3: sound and bubbles.

The first three flipeffects can assign samples, whilst the fourth removes them.
But the OBJ_GEM_SMASH sample is still hardcoded to play when a flare is igniting.
Note that the sample assigned to burning flares must have the L flag in Sounds.txt.

The remaining flipeffects can enable or disable:

- Bubble generation when the flare is underwater;
- Synchronization between light and sound/bubbles.
